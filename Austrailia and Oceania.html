<p>Obesity in Oceania has been a problem that may be worse than any other continent so far, with a handful of nations in the area being on the list for most obese in the world. The locals in Oceania have been analyzed to find out that they have genes that would not be suited well with obesity. </p>

<p>
The process of building those genes comes from a multitude of factors, with one of the big ones being the diet of an individual. The local diet back then may have consisted of healthy foods such as red meat, which also contains high cholesterol, and fruit. Unfortunately, the locals were eating too much of the food, way more than they needed since they were not exercising as much and remained quite sedentary, which led to gaining large amounts of useless wait, even when you consume healthy foods. 
</p>
<p>
The problem became worse later when people were getting access to more processed foods rather than the traditional healthy foods that they once ate on a regular basis. Complemented with the old habits of eating too much of it and sedentary lifestyles, obesity in Oceania has reached an all-time high.</p>
