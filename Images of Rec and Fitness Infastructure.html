<body><h1>Examples of Areas I have been to in my community</h1>
<p>When I was working on this project, I went around the Capilano University Campus to find 
    images of examples that are present today. To show what types of areas you would go in order to 
    decrease your chances of obesity.

     The Fit4Less gym is found in Capilano Mall.
