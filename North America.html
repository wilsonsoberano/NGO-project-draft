<h1> Facts in America</h1>

<body>
<p> Obesity in North America originates from a variety of different variables such as lackluster sleep, unfortunate genetics, ultra processed foods, an established sedentary culture, and expensive health care. Those factors derive from the rise of excessive playtime in video games, which leads to a sedentary lifestyle and lack of sleep. 

 Another factor is how car-centric countries like United States and Canada are, which further encourages a sedentary culture, unless you would prefer to walk, costing you much more time. 
</p>
 <p>Fast food companies also don’t help with how processed diets have been in not just North America, but the entire world, with McDonalds being a staple on every continent with a sustainable human population.
  Fast food in North America can cause extreme inflammation through an imbalance of fatty acids heavily leaning towards omega 6 fatty acids. Which means that North Americans don’t consume enough omega 3 fats which come from fresh, natural foods, such as fish and various nuts. 

 The excessive consumption of table sugar also doesn’t make life much easier, with beverages such as sodas have been more prevalent in recent years. It can cause a decrease in energy levels in the long run due to a decrease in testosterone levels, which are responsible for how you feel throughout your life. 
</p>
The number of American adults that are classified as obese is around 42% across all states. With a study showing that adults between ages 40-59 are more susceptible to obesity. 

The number of children that are obese between ages 2-19 in America is around 20% across all states. The children who are already overweight are more likely to become obese as adults, which can cause health diseases and other problems later in their life, which includes passing those problems to their children that they may have through genes. 

In the United States, a study shows as of 2022, every state has an obesity rate over 20% with a couple of them reaching over 35%.</p>
