Obesity in Africa, the status of the population's health, is polarizing. In rural areas, obesity is not a societal issue, due to the disparity of work between rural and urban environments when it comes to living. In rural areas, you would have to walk around to get to where you need to be, as the area is not designed to be car centric, which means people did not need cars to go to their destination, as well as public transportation.  

The food in African rural areas, are also not as processed as food in urban areas not just in Africa, but around the world. It also helps that those rural areas have farms where people are physically working to harvest the crops.

<p>There is also a socioeconomic factor in urban areas of Africa. Sometimes, being a larger, more overweight individual expresses a greater societal status than people who are skinnier, because it shows that they have great access to food due to having the money to afford it. </p>

<p>On the contrary, there are counter measures to the rise of obesity in urban environments, with one of them being the extra taxes that are inflicted on people who purchase sugary drinks, or change school diets by changing the food entirely to good old natural, organic foods from the farms.  

The highest increase of obesity in an African society, is in Egypt with around a 30% increase in adults. This is mainly due to how urbanized Egyptian society became in recent years, with lifestyles more sedentary than ever, and processed foods showing up in every corner. Of course, there would be solutions such as promoting sporting clubs to endorse physical activities, and limiting the promotion of junk food, as well as implementing the tax on sodas to give more opportunities to drink clean water.
