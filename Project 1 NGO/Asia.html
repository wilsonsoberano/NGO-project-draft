Obesity in Asia, like Africa, is quite polarizing throughout all the nations on the continent. With countries having low rates of obesity such as Japan and Thailand, as well as countries having high rates, with Indonesia and Saudi Arabia being examples of that.  

The main issues with obesity in Asia come from the diets that children would acquire and maintain throughout adulthood. Other factors, such as the urbanization of certain areas to incentivize motorbikes, gave an increase to sedentary lifestyles across Asia, alongside the option to switch from in-person classes to online classes, so kids donâ€™t even have to walk to school and move around with friends.

<p> Southeast Asia, the obesity rate is expected to double in 2030 from 2010, with around 30 million people already obese back then. 

The medical costs for treating obesity in Asia also is not cheap. As healthcare institutions may not have the resources to figure out medical solutions such as drugs to obesity, due to the lack of money they must afford it in the first place. Obesity can also cause a chain reaction to ones economic status, as if you are obese, you may not be fit to work for too long due to the physical disadvantages of being overweight, such as the lack of testosterone, which brings a lack of energy and drive to do anything.  

That can lead to an early retirement or being replaced by someone who is more fit to do your job. Either situation leads to a lack of money for yourself and your family, which can resort in purchasing foods that are affordable, but can be heavily processed. The economic cost in the healthcare industry also took a massive hit with the introduction to COVID. Which made sure that money is spent on resources figuring out COVID, rather than obesity. COVID also made sure that people stayed inside due to the pandemic, which means that people are stuck at home, most likely not moving enough.
