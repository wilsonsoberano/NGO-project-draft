 <p>South America, or Latin America, has been facing an uphill battle with obesity in recent memory. With most accessible food being highly processed, having an unsatisfying healthcare system, and societal standards that favor obesity. 

 South America is a continent that has most of its population living in urbanized conditions, which means cities that are dependent on cars instead of walking or cycling. The cities are also plagued by a myriad of fast-food restaurants.

<p>Fast food in South America, such as McDonalds and native establishments in that region is like North America where inflammation and high blood pressure through sugars and seed oils is the product of dedicating a lifestyle through frequently eating those foods. 

 Obese health care in South America remains underdeveloped compared to some of the other continents listed with obesity problems. The reason why is due to the lack of participation from people who are obese to speak about their experience battling obesity. A method like that gives more valuable information, rather than going off stigmas and stereotypes. It leaves the researchers struggling to find more root causes of why South America is having a tougher time dealing with obesity than any other continent out there. 

 Fast food in South America can cause extreme inflammation through an imbalance of fatty acids heavily leaning towards omega 6 fatty acids. Which means that South Americans donâ€™t consume enough omega 3 fats which come from fresh, natural foods, such as fish and various nuts. The same can be said with table sugar.
