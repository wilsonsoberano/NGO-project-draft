    <h1>Obesity Around the World</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the site where you can find the rates, causes and effects of obesity all across
        the globe. This Page consists of all the continents in the world that have been affected by obesity in any way, which means that 
        Antarctica will not be part of the list as there are no human inhabitants other than research facility people whos diets are from different parts of the world!
